**Fundamentals for all coding professions**
---------------------------------------

If I had to pick one meta-resource for choosing your learning materials it would be:

*   CLass Central

If I had to pick a few resources for getting started it would be

*   Scrimba, Microsoft Learn, YouTube or EdX for HTML, CSS & Javascript.
*   YouTube or EdX for VS Code, Git & GitHub.
*   EdX, Coursera & Udemy for consolidating HTML, CSS, Javascript & React (IBM, W3C, Harvard, Hong Kong, UC Davis, Colt Steele, etc)
*   DataCamp, Codecademy, SoloLearn, W3 Schools etc for basic SQL
*   EdX & Coursera for Python & more Javascript & more SQL (Harvard, Stanford, MIT, IBM, UC Davis, UMichigan)
*   Codecademy or Coursera (Princeton, Duke & UC San Diego) for Java
*   Udemy (Colt Steele), FreeCodeCamp & LinkedIn for more SQL
*   Coursera (UMichigan), FreeCodeCamp, Udemy & ISTQB for testing


Although these skills can be learnt in many different orders, I suggest starting with the order I have given here.

Rather than starting with a specific coding language, I'd recommend starting with the fundamentals that everyone needs to know. Other roadmaps tend to delay the learning of these fundamental skills or even forget to mention some of them entirely, but since they are essential to the workflow of any language, you may as well get them right form the start.

You don't need to be a master of each of these skills to move onto the next step in the road map. The basics are enough for now. In fact, generally speaking, you should just learn the bare minimum you need to move onto the next skill, as the add-on tool skills like React are often more practical & don't generally require comprehensive mastery of the previous levels. You can then come back and deepen the more fundamental skills as needed.

If you don't know what a command-line interface is, or anything else mentioned in this roadmap for that matter, and a link is not provided, web search it (Google it) and have a quick read of the definition.

If you're more interested in the back-end, you might start coming across skills that you don't feel you need once you get to the front-end skills section. That's where it becomes a choose your own adventure, but honestly I think even if you want to become a backend developer, you need to know the absolute basics of HTML & CSS, and it isn't a bad place to start. As a markup language, HTML is much simpler than even python, so it's a great language to practice with while you're still mastering the basics of VC Code & Version Control. Building your own portoflio website to show off your back-end skills is not necessary to find back-end developer work, but it's not a bad idea, and if you want to do it, it will require front-end skills. Meanwhile, you don't need back-end skills to show off your front-end skills. You can immediately start showing off what you've learnt with GitHub pages for example.

On the other hand, the corresponding argument can also be made that even if you want to be a fron-end web developer, learning python fairly early on isn't a bad idea in order to [automate the boring stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/>). In addition, there are high quality freemimum courses in Python program from universities like Harvard & MIT, some of which also serve as a good general introduction to computer science. I'd still lean towards learning HTML & CSS first because it's probably easier for most people, but it's not a bad idea to learn python early on too.

Another back-end skill you may want to learn fairly early on even if you want to be a front-end developer is SQL, if only because for many entry level positions this seems to be the skill that help the most for getting the job, and you can always keep learning front-end development in your own time if you aren't learning enough on the job.

### **Good resources overall**

Here are some of the best resources overall for coding skills. You can check them out for any of the skills in this roadmap to see what's available.

#### **Predominantly free or freemium:**

*   EdX (Harvard, Stanford, MIT)
*   Microsoft Learn (Free)
*   FreeCodeCamp
*   SoloLearn
*   W3Schools
*   YouTube
*   Documentation

#### **Largely paid with many free or freemium courses:**

*   Scrimba
*   Coursera
*   Codecademy
*   Udemy

#### **Other:**

*   Exercism
*   Leetcode
*   Hackerrank
*   DataCamp
*   Microsoft

### **Command-line interfaces**

Here is a good list of the most basic commands in the two most common shell scripting languages used in command-line inerfaces: bash (Mac, Linux & Git Bash on Windows) and cmd (Windows only): [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-vs-windows-commands/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-vs-windows-commands/)

Ctrl+C can be used to terminate any process. For example, if you type "mk" and hit enter without naming the new directory, you will be asked some questions that no beginner is likely to understand, so type Ctrl+C to cancel.

**Mac & Linux: Bash (Bourne Again Shell)**

It'll probably be on your Mac or Linux system already, but you may wish to update to the latest version, using a web search for instructions.

**Windows: Command prompt (cmd), Git Bash, Powershell & Terminal**

These should be on your Windows system already, but you may wish to understand the difference between, for example from these two articles:

*   https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-terminal-vs-powershell/
*   https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-bash

or if you really hate reading that much, from some of these videos:

*   https://www.youtube.com/results?search\_query=cmd+vs
*   https://www.youtube.com/results?search\_query=git+bash+vs
*   https://www.youtube.com/results?search\_query=powershell+vs
*   https://www.youtube.com/results?search\_query=windows+terminal+vs

### **Source-code editors**

Some roadmaps neglect to mention that learning to use a code editor efficiently is a non-trivial skill, and since you'll be using some kind of editor from the beginning, you may as well learn to use it efficiently right at the start, perhaps before you've even started to learn a coding language such as a programming language or markup language, or perhaps simulatenously with learning the basics of your chosen language. HTML is a great choice for initial practice in a code editor.

#### **VS Code**

VS code is what is generally recommended, and with good reasons. It is a great editor (and more), but there are plenty of great free resources on how to use it efficiently, including YouTube [videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=visual+studio+code) & [playlists](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=visual+studio+code&sp=EgIQAw), and some basic introductory articles such as this one: https://www.codecademy.com/article/visual-studio-code or if you want to buy a short course, there are some on Coursera and Udemy.

#### **Other source-code editors**

There are basically two types of alternative to VS Code that are meaningully different in functionality: command line editors that are desinged to be used without a mouse like Vim & NeoVim, and IDEs like those from JetBrains, which are designed to offer more features (that you probably won't need as a beginner), and are often premium paid products. The best bet, until you have a very good reason not to, is to use VS Code.

### **Version control**

#### **Git**

#### Courses:

*   FreeCodeCamp (Free)
*   John Hopkins University (Freemium)
*   Colt Steele (Free/Paid)

#### **Github (Repository hosting)**

**Choose your adventure**
---------------------

Although my suggestion is to learn the fundamental language-agnostic skills like VS code, git & git hub first, I otherwise think the roadmaps at [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/roadmaps) look great, especially the Frontend and Backend road maps. Feel free to use those from this point onwards, but here are the courses that I'm doing myself, those that I'm planning to do, and those that look the best value as alternatives.
